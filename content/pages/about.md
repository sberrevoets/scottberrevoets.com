Hi, I'm Scott! Back in 2014 I started as one of Lyft's first iOS hires, and I
still work there now. I've seen and helped the apps grow from a monolithic
Objective-C codebase to a highly sophisticated class of apps and underlying
technologies.

I'm currently on Lyft's Mobile Infrastructure team, where I look after the
quality and scalability of our iOS and Android codebases.
