Hi, I'm Scott! Back in 2014 I started as one of Lyft's first iOS hires, and I
still work there now. I've seen and helped the apps grow from a monolithic
Objective-C codebase to a highly sophisticated class of apps and underlying
technologies.

I'm currently on Lyft's Mobile Infra team, where I look after the quality and
scalability of our iOS and Android codebases.

Some my other extracurriculars include:

* [Kodeco] tech editor
* Lyft Mobile Podcast [part 1] &amp; [part 2]
* [Advanced Auto Layout] at RWDevCon 2017
* [Keeping the Lyft App Accessible]

For a full list of my work, check out my [resume]({static}/resume.pdf).
