üëã I'm Scott, a software engineer specialized in iOS development since 2011,
currently over at [Speak] on the Platform team. Before that I was at Lyft for
almost 11 years, building the mobile apps, teams, and community.

I live in San Francisco and am always happy to chat&mdash;feel free to reach
out! For an overview of my work, check out my resume in
[PDF]({static}/resume.pdf) or [HTML]({static}/resume.html).

### Speak (current)
I recently took on a software engineering role at language-learning unicorn
[Speak] to build its mobile platform.

### Lyft (2014 &ndash; 2025)
As one of Lyft's first iOS hires, I started out as a product engineer building
out some of the fundamental features and technologies that today define the
rideshare industry. Over time I switched gears to iOS infrastructure
(specifically architecture) and transitioned into a tech lead role for Lyft's
150-engineer Mobile team while focusing on the quality and scalability of the
iOS and Android codebases.
