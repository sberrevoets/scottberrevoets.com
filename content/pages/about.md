<img src="/images/me.jpg" id="me">

Hi, Iâ€™m Scott! After a few years doing web development I found my passion in iOS development. I work as an iOS developer for [Lyft](http://lyft.com) in San Francisco, and do some side work as an author and tech editor for [raywenderlich.com](http://raywenderlich.com).

If you want to contact me, use one of the social platforms above, or send me an email at `blog` at this domain. Recruiters, don't bother.
