# ScottBerrevoets.com

This repository contains the source for
[ScottBerrevoets.com](http://scottberrevoets.com). It uses
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com) to generate all content, including file and
directory structures. I'm using a custom Pelican theme. You may use this theme
for your own Pelican installation, but I can't help you out with customizations.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip3 install
```

## Writing

Because I always forget.

- Edit content, then run `$ pelican content` from the root
- To preview: `$ pelican --listen` (with `-r` for continuous regeneration)
